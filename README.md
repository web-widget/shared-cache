# SharedCache

An http cache following http header semantics. It implements the [Cache Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache), but it DOES NOT follow the Cache Interface specification.

SharedCache tells when responses can be reused from a cache, taking into account [HTTP RFC 7234](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7234.html) rules for user agents and shared caches. It also implements [RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861), implementing `stale-if-error` and `stale-while-revalidate`.
It's aware of many tricky details such as the `vary` header, proxy revalidation, and authenticated responsesã€‚

- Support custom cache storage sources, such as using Redis to implement cluster shared cache
- It extends the caching capabilities of the `fetch` function
- Support custom Cache Key, for example, you can cache specific members of device types, cookies and headers

## Why SharedCache

Although the use of the Web `fetch` API has become very common on the server side, there is still a lack of standardized cache API on the server side. SharedCache refers to Cloudflare Workers Cache and many projects, hoping to define a better cache API.

Since a browser's cache usually targets a single user, a server's cache usually serves all users, which is why this project is called SharedCache.

## Installation

```
npm i @web-widget/shared-cache
```

## Usage

```ts
import {
  CacheStorage,
  createFetch,
  type KVStorage,
} from '@web-widget/shared-cache';
import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache';

// Optionally provide a settings for the LRU cache. Options are defined here:
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache
const createLRUCache = (): KVStorage => {
  const store = new LRUCache<string, any>({ max: 1024 });

  return {
    async get(cacheKey: string) {
      return store.get(cacheKey) as any | undefined;
    },
    async set(cacheKey: string, value: any, ttl?: number) {
      store.set(cacheKey, value, { ttl });
    },
    async delete(cacheKey: string) {
      return store.delete(cacheKey);
    },
  };
};

const caches = new CacheStorage(createLRUCache());

async function run() {
  const cache = await caches.open('v1');
  const fetch = createFetch(cache);
  // Make a request
  // Logs "response1: 425.793ms"
  console.time('response1');
  const response1 = await fetch(
    'https://httpbin.org/response-headers?cache-control=max-age%3D604800'
  );
  console.timeEnd('response1');
  // Make a request to the same location
  // Logs "response2: 1.74ms" because the response was cached
  console.time('response2');
  const response2 = await fetch(
    'https://httpbin.org/response-headers?cache-control=max-age%3D604800'
  );
  console.timeEnd('response2');
}
run();
```

## Create global `caches` and `fetch`

The global `cahces` object needs to be defined beforehand. The `cahces` object is a global instance of the `CacheStorage` class.

```ts
import { CacheStorage, type KVStorage } from '@web-widget/shared-cache';
import { LRUCache } from 'lru-cache';

declare global {
  interface WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
    caches: CacheStorage;
  }
}

const createLRUCache = (): KVStorage => {
  const store = new LRUCache<string, any>({ max: 1024 });

  return {
    async get(cacheKey: string) {
      return store.get(cacheKey) as any | undefined;
    },
    async set(cacheKey: string, value: any, ttl?: number) {
      store.set(cacheKey, value, { ttl });
    },
    async delete(cacheKey: string) {
      return store.delete(cacheKey);
    },
  };
};

const caches = new CacheStorage(createLRUCache());
globalThis.caches = caches;
```

When the above global `caches` object is ready, you can also register the globally registered cacheable `fetch`:

```ts
import { fetch, type SharedCacheFetch } from '@web-widget/shared-cache';

declare global {
  interface WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope {
    fetch: SharedCacheFetch;
  }
}

globalThis.fetch = fetch;
```

## `fetch` function

The `fetch` function extends the specification with additional `sharedCache` options.

```ts
const res = await fetch('https://httpbin.org/response-headers', {
  sharedCache: {
    cacheControlOverride: 's-maxage=120',
    varyOverride: '',
    cacheKeyRules: {
      host: true,
      method: { include: ['GET', 'HEAD'] },
      pathname: true,
      search: false,
      device: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### `sharedCache`

#### `cacheControlOverride`

Since many APIs do not configure cache headers correctly, you can use override cache control values.

#### `varyOverride`

You can use override vary values.

#### `cacheKeyRules`

Custom cache key. See also [`CacheQueryOptions`](#cachequeryoptions).

## `CacheStorage` class

The `CacheStorage` class implements [CacheStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage) interface, but does not implement its specification. It deviates from it in a few ways.

### `open`

Returns a Promise that resolves to the Cache object matching the cacheName (a new cache is created if it doesn't already exist.) This method follows the specification.

### `delete`

Finds the Cache object matching the cacheName, and if found, deletes the Cache object and returns a Promise that resolves to true. If no Cache object is found, it resolves to false. This method follows the specification.

### ~~`match`~~

Not implemented.

### ~~`has`~~

Not implemented.

### ~~`keys`~~

Not implemented.

## `Cache` class

The `Cache` class implements [Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) interface, but does not implement its specification. It deviates from it in a few ways.

### `match(request, options)`

Checks the cache to see if it includes the response to the given request. If it does and the response isn't stale, it returns the response. Otherwise, it will make a fetch, cache the response, and return the response.

#### Parameters

- `request` The Request for which you are attempting to find responses in the Cache. See also [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- `options` An object that sets options for the match operation. See also [`CacheQueryOptions`](#cachequeryoptions)

### `put(request, response, options)`

Takes both a request and its response and adds it to the given cache if allowed. This method deviates from the specification in a few ways:

It has extra protections beyond the specification. For example, a response that includes the `cahce-control: no-cache` will not be stored in this library, but would be stored in a specification compliant library.

#### Parameters

- `request` The Request object or URL that you want to add to the cache. See also [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- `response` The Response you want to match up to the request. See also [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)
- `options` An object that sets options for the put operation. See also [`CacheQueryOptions`](#cachequeryoptions)

### `delete(request, options)`

Finds the Cache entry whose key is the request, returning a Promise that resolves to true if a matching Cache entry is found and deleted. If no Cache entry is found, the promise resolves to false. This method follows the specification.

#### Parameters

- `request` The Request you are looking to delete. See also [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)
- `options` An object whose properties control how matching is done in the delete operation. See also [`CacheQueryOptions`](#cachequeryoptions)

### ~~`add`~~

Not implemented.

### ~~`addAll`~~

Not implemented.

### ~~`keys`~~

Not implemented.

## `CacheQueryOptions`

This is an option for query caching which extends the specification.

### `cacheKeyRules`

Custom cache key generation rules.

Default value:

```ts
{
  host: true,
  method: { include: ['GET', 'HEAD'] },
  pathname: true,
  search: true,
}
```

List of built-in supported parts:

- `host`
- `method`
- `pathname`
- `search`
- `cookie`
- `device`
- `header`

#### Search

The query string controls which URL query string parameters go into the Cache Key. You can `include` specific query string parameters or `exclude` them using the respective fields. When you include a query string parameter, the `value` of the query string parameter is used in the Cache Key.

##### Example

If you include the query string foo in a URL like `https://www.example.com/?foo=bar`, then bar appears in the Cache Key. Exactly one of `include` or `exclude` is expected.

```ts
{
  search: {
    include: ['foo'],
  },
}
```

##### Usage notes

- To include all query string parameters (the default behavior), use include: `true`
- To ignore query strings, use exclude: `false`
- To include most query string parameters but exclude a few, use the exclude field which assumes the other query string parameters are included.

#### Headers

Headers control which headers go into the Cache Key. Similar to Query String, you can include specific headers or exclude default headers.

When you include a header, the header value is included in the Cache Key. For example, if an HTTP request contains an HTTP header like `X-Auth-API-key: 12345`, and you include the `X-Auth-API-Key header` in your Cache Key Template, then `12345` appears in the Cache Key.

To check for the presence of a header without including its actual value, use the `check_presence` option.

Currently, you can only exclude the `Origin` header. The `Origin` header is always included unless explicitly excluded. Including the [Origin header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) in the Cache Key is important to enforce [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS). Additionally, you cannot include the following headers:

- Headers that have high cardinality and risk sharding the cache
  - `accept`
  - `accept-charset`
  - `accept-encoding`
  - `accept-datetime`
  - `accept-language`
  - `referer`
  - `user-agent`
- Headers that re-implement cache or proxy features
  - `connection`
  - `content-length`
  - `cache-control`
  - `if-match`
  - `if-modified-since`
  - `if-none-match`
  - `if-unmodified-since`
  - `range`
  - `upgrade`
- Headers that are covered by other Cache Key features
  - `cookie`
  - `host`
- Headers that cache status
  - `x-cache-status`

#### Host

Host determines which host header to include in the Cache Key.

#### Cookie

Like `query_string` or `header`, `cookie` controls which cookies appear in the Cache Key. You can either include the cookie value or check for the presence of a particular cookie.

#### Device

Classifies a request as `mobile`, `desktop`, or `tablet` based on the User Agent.

### `forceCache`

### `ignoreCacheControl`

### ~~`ignoreMethod`~~

Will be ignored.

### ~~`ignoreSearch`~~

Will be ignored.

### ~~`ignoreVary`~~

Will be ignored.
