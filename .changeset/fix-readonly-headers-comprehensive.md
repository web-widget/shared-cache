fix: Comprehensive fix for readonly headers modification issues

This change completely resolves the readonly headers modification problems that were partially addressed in the previous fix. The solution includes:

**New Features:**
- Added `src/utils/response.ts` with intelligent response utilities:
  - `modifyResponseHeaders()`: Smart header modification with readonly fallback
  - `setResponseHeader()`: Convenient single header setting function

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed `setCacheStatus()` function in `fetch.ts` to properly handle readonly headers
- Optimized `createInterceptor()` function to avoid unnecessary Response cloning
- Ensured `cache.ts` uses safe header modification patterns
- All header modifications now gracefully handle readonly scenarios

**Performance Improvements:**
- No Response cloning when no header overrides are configured
- Direct header modification when possible (for mutable headers)
- Smart fallback to new Response creation only when necessary
- Significant performance improvement for common use cases

**Testing:**
- Added comprehensive unit tests for response utilities (10 new tests)
- Added specific tests for createInterceptor readonly headers handling (6 new tests)
- All 258 tests pass with 93.93% code coverage
- Tests cover edge cases, error scenarios, and performance considerations

This fix ensures that header modifications work reliably across all environments (browser, Node.js, etc.) while maintaining optimal performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
